          Hello! I'm Kevin, a high school senior. I love learning about people and the world, and I dream of fostering fulfillment, curiosity, and kindness in the world around us, starting with myself. To this end, I hope to pursue math, which forms the backbone of the world around us, and computer science, which brings ideas and creativity to scale. I'm also interested in connecting with peopleâ€”through teaching, conversation, or building communities.
