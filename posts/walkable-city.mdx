Frisco, Texas is a very walkable city. 

4B second-semester junior year was my favorite ninety minutes of the day, and not just because I could leave school early. I didn’t have a car or a ride home, so I’d bolt out the door at 2:50 and do some math competition problems in the hallway until the teachers kicked me out; then I’d move to the cafeteria. Sometimes, when teachers were watching the cafeteria, I’d sit in the bathroom stall for the entire ninety minutes – not my proudest moment. But now I know which places you won’t find teachers and at what times the janitors clean the school cafeteria. The school feels a lot different when you’re lonely. The bustling ceases, and you only hear a faint vacuum and the occasional teacher yelling at you. The school feels hollow. In the solitude of silence, math competition problems kept me company, and so January ticked by.

But that’s the amazing thing about walking. There are not too many places to go, so you learn the intricacies of every shop, every hallway of every building, even which blades of grass have dog poop in them (I learned this one the hard way). I can stay within the hollow solitude of my school, or I’ll go outside to the parking garage and sit near the pebbles whilst working on my SPARC application, waiting for the DECA state testing to open. I’ll see my friends pass by and wave, or hide myself in embarrassment. Sometimes I’ll walk along the path to the CTE center and camouflage myself amongst the entering students, then find a nice chair to sit on. The CTE center felt a lot more homey, kind of like the library until they kicked me out. If they don’t, I’ll leave at 4:15 sharp and walk along the football field, the same route I walked with friends after CS3 third period. It feels a lot more empty by yourself. 

If I’m feeling lucky, I’ll sit on the green lawn near the admin building. The sun is bright, and it’s hard to use your computer unless you sit in a pocket of shade near the sewers. I’ll lie on the grass and feel the soft spring breeze blowing my papers away again and again. Sometimes, parents will walk their crying toddlers by me. It’s picturesque. 

Or I’ll wrap around the school, to the lawn outside the cafeteria. Sometimes teachers will spot me and I’ll have to run. Or I’ll lie on the grass right outside the fence, overlooking the lake in the distance. I might go for a quick lap. 

If I turn right from the parking lot, I’m greeted by a small square with all you can ask for. Whataburger, where I go before every orchestra concert and after our spring UIL. Sprouts, Mardel’s Christian Book Store, and there’s an Einstein Bagels shop further down. Early release taught me that Sprouts offers free samples: I’d go in, and grab myself some banana chips and chocolate almonds. Occasionally, I’d buy pastries or fruits, and read some of the newspapers in the line. I’d resist the tantalizing urge to buy a bag of dried apricots. There are a lot of old white people at Sprouts, and they are super nice; I wished I was more proactive in talking to them. Sprouts had chairs outside that I’d sit in and do some work, and sometimes I’d see classmates walk my way. I might prefer the quiet of Mardel’s bookstores: there’s a nice, comfortable chair in the back disrupted only by some soft Christian music and the occasional shopper looking for Easter gifts. Mardel’s is very homey. Maybe I’ll sit aside on the grass, trying to not let the wind blow away my papers, and enjoy the hustle as people come and go. 

If I’m lucky, Esther will pick me up and I feel the luxury of the car: even if I have to constantly bend over to fit my head inside. Share Tea, a delicacy unattainable during early release, became a distinguishing experience. We’d talk for hours about our (mainly her) lives, and she’d get me to take a personality test that says “Kevin, we’re the same personality type.” This is why I don’t buy into personality tests.

Sometimes I’ll ask a friend to hang out after school. We usually go to Sprouts, where I show them around free samples and we sit in the chairs outside, or Einstein Bagels where I order avocado toast. I love these conversations because they’re surprisingly genuine. I remember a DECA practice-turned hours-long conversation with LC, trips to Einstein Bagels with EZ, and a walk to the lake with AV, amongst a couple of others. The frivolities of conversation melt easily. It’s just me and them, until the phone shows 4:20 and we scramble to the buses.

Even if I couldn’t drive, I could walk anywhere – the freedom was all mine, and I knew every place, every item sold like the back of my hand. Now, I drive home from school to the tune of the sticky summer wind and the droning AC. Driving has its limits: being able to go anywhere, you lose appreciation for the finer details of all the places you can go. We take things for granted so easily: even the luxury of driving causes us to forget how pretty and freeing the world is when you take a ten-minute walk outside campus. 

Lebanon Trail High School is a very walkable campus. Oftentimes I find myself dreaming about all the places I want to go and the people I want to meet. The truth is, there are two thousand people and two thousand walkable shops I haven’t visited. Some of them sit by themselves. We take so much for granted. There’s a lot of stories behind each of those unnamed faces. 

During the first week of block lunch, I tried to embrace the change. I found a girl sitting by herself – she’s a junior from Hong Kong. That’s about all I know since I couldn’t understand a word she said for the rest of the thirty minutes of lunch …
