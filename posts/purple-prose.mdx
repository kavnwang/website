The door opens to chaos and my dog’s mischievous grin. The spruce floor is decorated by shredded paper and pinwheels while dug-up trash and shoes lie on the second-story bed, says Apple’s “Pet Friends Over The Years” album.

But I don’t know, and I don’t hear Mom’s impatient shouting, the faint barking at the mailman, the soft clattering of Kudo jumping from sofa to sofa. All I can see today is Kudo’s half-alive self as he stares statue-like on the couch, only rolling down after we constantly coax him to eat his dinner. 

But that’s what photographs do. They tell you what’s not there, and they show you what you can’t see. I can’t argue with Kudo jumping on the kitchen table searching for ribs—my iPhone lens captures unarguable evidence. Thanks to my questionable long-term memory, my only memory of my childhood comes from thousands of photographs. Yes, I suppose that’s me next to LegoLand. The brief flashes of emotion I can recall are equally colorless. Yes, I suppose I cried that day. Flipping through albums is less nostalgic and more educational as I learn about what younger Kevin has supposedly done. 

What can I do but believe my photographs?  I haven’t seen my grandparents since I last visited China at age eight. Only through my parents’ faint retellings of their childhood tales, weekly “love you Grandma” over a brightly lit screen, and photographs, can I understand—yes, it is a matter of fact that I have grandparents in China. And without photos, I couldn’t even be sure that they aren’t some social experiment my parents concocted to not feel different than everyone else with grandparents. But I suppose, yes, that is eight-year-old Kevin smiling next to people that consistently show up as my grandparents. 

But photographs don’t always tell the truth. I’m seen grinning ear to ear on a family trip to Sedona, but no one captures the next hour, as I get fed up with my parents taking picture after picture after picture and walk off alone on a sandy red back trail in an act of defiance. I don’t know what happened next, since there’s no photographs of that. 

A couple of years ago, tragedy almost struck. Baby Kevin—his consciousness stored in thousands of JPGs—almost died as I installed Windows on my family album’s hard drive, overwriting the previous files. I’ve never seen Dad so mad before, although it’s not like I would know, since he always smiled in the photos we took. I almost lost my entire childhood, or at least what appeared to be my childhood. The truth? I never knew what my childhood looked like in the first place. 

But Dad clung on to those idealized photos of our family, the pixels recreating the half-truth of our lives. Perhaps to remember twenty years from now, when we’re all old. Oh yes, I remember San Diego! You slept like a baby the entire trip. We tried showing you the pandas, but the only thing you were interested in was the yellow 2 you held. And then he’d stitch together his ideal story of my childhood, white smiles and rosy cheeks covering up candy wrappers and cigarettes. 

Or maybe the photographs were what he wanted to create all along, those still-motion portraits embodying his dream of how he wanted to raise me for all those years. And as photographs die, so too does our ideal childhood world, of happily ever afters and never-wilting pink blossoms. 

And who can blame him? Maybe parenting is a second chance, where we turn back time and fix all of our past regrets. If our kids live happily ever after, then maybe we could too. Dad tells me to “focus on your studies and don’t waste your time. Those kids in China preparing for the GaoKao have it much worse than you,” so I don’t blow my chances of a good college with political activism like he did, so I can have a financially stable future. Mom convinces me to exercise by saying “she used to burn the midnight oil researching back in China, and if you don’t want to struggle with heart issues later in life, you should take care of your body.” 

After all, isn’t that why they left all their family and friends behind when they moved from China to the United States? By giving me the idealized childhood they dreamed of, their regrets could take meaning. 

But how could I understand? I see China through absurd Chinese dramas that I’ve watched with Mom, my parents’ warnings on the lessons they learned in China, and photographs of my parents and grandparents, but what does any of this mean? China is apparently where my loving grandparents and relatives are, but the only things I know about them are the detached truths captured in 4x6 frames near our fireplace. 

All I can infer about China is what I have in the United States—golden afternoons lying under the slants of sunlight from the window, nights alone as my parents work overtime, summers spent in my house’s solitude, with only my thoughts as company. I don’t know what China feels like, but I know China won’t feel like boarded-up fireplaces on Christmas because it’s too cold or Chinese New Year Eves with every tradition except a platter of dumplings forgotten. China is as foreign to me as the United States was to my parents—merely our grandest dreams captured by smiling photographs. 

And although I’ve never been a picture guy—I’ve started countless arguments on vacations as I impatiently watch my parents snap away—I’m taking my own photographs. I’ve given several justifications in my college essays on why I teach, but perhaps teaching just gives me an outlet to give my own regrets meaning, just like taking idealized family photos gave my parents’ regrets in China meaning. Through every pen stroke and every dried Expo marker, I’m pouring out everything I’ve learned over years of late nights alone, bashing my head against pages of indecipherable algebra. 

Because just like my parents’ treasured photographs, I teach for the dream that my kids don’t have to learn algebra through dimly lit lamps and the solitude of hollow walls. Maybe I too can turn back time and live happily ever after. 

So we live, we laugh, and now we tell our stories

—through purple prose and photographs.
