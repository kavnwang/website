A few months ago, I reflected that I’d try to live as if I was 0% shaped by circumstances, but believe that others were 100% shaped by circumstances. This is an inherent double standard and false, but I viewed it as a way to hold myself accountable and push myself whilst retaining empathy for others around me. A pretty roundabout way of saying judging only myself.

I don’t think this is the best mindset anymore; whether we like it or not, the people around us (or lack thereof) do shape our identity. And recognizing the ways others bring out the best—and worst—in us is crucial to developing environments that foster growth not only for ourselves, but for those around us. Ultimately, the people around us shape our identity, and pretending otherwise would be foolish and counterproductive.

It would then follow to be the change you’d like to see in yourself. Improving on the values you care about is difficult without others, even if you’re exceptionally reflective. You should encourage others to care about the same values you do, and create a culture of initiative, enabling others to find unique ways built off their own life experiences to pursue values that you wouldn’t have considered.

But how do you get others to care based on values?

Maybe it isn’t so hard. I believe (most) humans are more fundamentally similar than we think. The pursuit of happiness, a sense of justice for oneself, the value of time, compassion—such traits permeate almost all cultures and religions. Wisdom is a lot more about application than theory. (I’m not sure what those “It’s okay to not know but it’s not okay to not try” posters teachers hang up are really doing). And although we apply wisdom in different ways, those underlying values are overwhelmingly similar.

After all, the reason we enjoy the hobbies we do are for very similar reasons. Music, reading, and watching TV shows and movies helps us feel, and writing, blogging, podcasting, painting helps us understand how we feel. Sports and video games satisfy our competitive urges—from our underlying thirst for self-importance. For those who shun hobbies for “productivity”—gym, work—they’re still fulfilling their desire for meaningfulness in life and validation. We are all driven by similar things.

As an aside, I believe the reason that math is so shunned is because it’s a lot harder for outsiders to understand the underlying connections. Math is really, really beautiful—as is everything in life—but it takes a lot more dedication to math to really understand its beauty than Picasso or Mozart, and certainly school systems don’t help with this.

So if we’re all so similar, why do we gravitate towards certain people and friend groups? With [X], we’re upbeat and lively, gushing over common interests and hobbies. But with [Y], we’re not sure what to say next; and when we do know, somehow it feels wrong, as if our identity is being compromised. Moreover, why are some people almost universally relatable and down-to-earth, whilst others are so hard to relate to?

My theory—which I don’t strongly believe in but find interesting—is the following model of identity. Human identity is a complex web of connections—thoughts, emotions, rationales—that holds together a lifetime of memories. To fully understand all the experiences that make a person, you’d need to live through dozens of years of a person’s life. Any conversation and get-to-know-you can’t even come close to untangling everything that shapes us. Even we often aren’t fully in touch with our emotions. There’s no way we would be able to show all of this in one introduction.

So, what we end up doing is some sort of a checklist approach. We introduce ourselves with hobbies: I’m a big foodie, I love pomeranian dogs, Go Cowboys! We have our own quirky personalities—eating pizza crust first or pop culture references or friendly teases—that make us interesting, funny, and memorable. Our lingo, demeanor, energy are all traits in the identity that we present. Some people seem generally approachable not because they actually are, but because the list of traits they define as their identity are:

* More similar / relatable to a general audience

* More adaptable / larger lists

So there’s a massive lossy compression going on between our true identities and the identities we present to ourselves. What ends up happening is that we unconsciously ascribe our presented identity as our true identity. We choose our identity, and assume it to be innately true, when whatever we define as our identity will always be incomplete.

This is sometimes useful—conversation starters tend to reside on faux disagreements. Arguing over whether pineapple should be on pizza, which musician is better, what’s the best holiday are classic icebreakers. And it’s completely harmless; after all, either you agree with me (and we’ll get along great) or we’ll have a passionate conversation. Win-win.

But there are also faults to this model.

* We tend to ascribe identity on results. This is natural, because identity and ego are intertwined, results are clearly measurable and can elicit admiration from others. But this leads to over-competitiveness, stress, and anxiety over maintaining said results-based identities.

* The model is inherently inefficient. The goal of conversations is to get to know the other person, unless, of course, the conversation is incentive-laden. But making assumptions based on what others have selected as their identity—which might not provide the best reflection of their person—can be presumptuous.

Perhaps most significantly, I’d argue this is a significant cause of problems around the world. Wars survive off conflicting patriotisms, which is rooted in designating nationality as a central aspect of one’s identity. If you compared US loyalty vs. Japan loyalty in World War II, for example, I’d believe that similar emotions and experiences led to both. But we don’t understand that, and so we fight. (I recognize this is a very, very gross oversimplification). I also believe partisan politics, socioeconomic inequality, and more are direct results of this. Because identity is intertwined into all of this, any disagreements quickly turn into assaults on identity, enabling conflicts to be blown way out of proportion and corrupt politicians to manipulate citizens for their own schemes.

You might think more empathy is the solution, but empathy is a buzzword that people sort of throw around without being empathetic on why people aren’t always empathetic. So I think these two pointers might be more actionable.

First, we should be cognizant of our identity, and strive to reduce it. It’s human nature to long for an identity—a home in this turbulent, confusing world. But in conversations and disagreements, we should strive to put aside our sense of identity. Why do political debates become a lot more heated than debates on the best musical artist? It’s because people ascribe a lot more of their identity on politics than musical preference. That doesn’t mean these debates aren’t worth having. There’s certainly facts worth picking out—which party’s healthcare plan is the most economical for [x] or [y] demographic. But identity needs to be put aside to turn debates from becoming attacks on ego.

Something else interesting is going on here. Aren’t musical artists and politics all inherently part of the list we ascribe as our identity? Are politics generally more important on this list? We unconsciously assign scales to each of our convictions—religion first, politics second, [x] third. But since identities are always tied into ego, we’re a lot more uncompromising than we should be in disagreements. By making a conscious effort to understand the scale of importance each aspect of our identity has, we’ll naturally reduce how much non-central aspects of identity matter to us and prevent faux disagreements from turning bigger than necessary. 

Secondly, the world needs new education systems. 

First experiences have a tremendous effect on people. Our perspectives are shaped by initial views to a great extent. I had a recent conversation with an artist; when I asked them why they found satisfaction in art but not music or math, they mentioned that they were entranced by the creativity that art provided, and he couldn’t see the creativity in music and math. But certainly, there is a lot of room for creative expression in both subjects. I think the cause is initial impressions: he learned music through orchestra classes and auditions that emphasized technical efficiency, and he learned math through school classes which, well…

But with art, he explored it in his free time, and without institutional restrictions, he felt art was more liberating and creative. His love for art over other disciplines does not stem as much from art itself as it does his first engagements with art. 

People form first impressions quickly, and do not let go of impressions easily. Forming impressions is simply human nature, and a major reason why we’re able to learn and adapt so quickly. And this extends beyond interests; it extends into people, worldviews, and identity. 

The last aspect is what I’m particularly interested in. People assume identities so easily and unconsciously, and because identity is tied deeply into self-worth, people staunchly refuse to let go of their identity, defending it even when all evidence suggests otherwise.

This is why government institutions remain unchanging, why America remains polarized, why nationalism remains effective to justify atrocities. This is also why individual people are so reluctant to change. They refuse to let go of their baggage of identity, even when it becomes outdated. 

Let me shift gears for a bit. At WARP, I had a great conversation with DY, who mentioned that he believed the world’s greatest challenge is that human technological development is accelerating much faster than human morality. Humans have progressed from knives to guns to atomic bombs in a couple of countries, but in terms of morality, little progress has been made. (This conversation changed my mind about the ethics of technological progress). 

So what is the next leap for moral progress? I think people need to start questioning their beliefs, and attempting to prove their beliefs wrong. This will naturally keep identity small and absolve the shortcomings I’ve mentioned earlier. Due to social media algorithms perpetuating existing views and polarizing stereotypes in media, we are taught to build on what we already believe, not question them. Many people who we deem ignorant or discriminatory are shaped by biased evidence that mangle how they see the world. Challenging preconceptions will also create a more empathetic world. 

And I believe new, revolutionary educational systems are the foundation of this type of large-scale change. Education is our first glimpse on the world, and where first impressions—as well as the tendency to believe first impressions—are formed. Many poorer educational areas simply lack the resources required to educate a youth population and for them to develop unbiased views. Even in the US, education promotes answering correctly, which furthers existing ideas, instead of questioning. The result: propagation of stereotypes as people absorb biased information without questioning. Fostering a questioning mindset starts in schools.

So here’s my proposal for a new educational system. Students should become teachers; after all, to truly master a student you should be able to teach it. We can design an AI-powered pupil for every student. They could ask simple questions—what’s the slope of the line y=2x+4?—but also more difficult ones that develop a pattern of questioning—asking students to offer alternative arguments against universal themes in novels, for example. There are ways to gamify / quantify learning: for example, a competition could be developed where AI pupils would take a test or competition, and the pupil’s scores would become a cumulative assessment of both the student’s knowledge and communication skills. But holistically, I think systems similar to this, built on cutting-edge technology, can change education to emphasize questioning, thus keeping identity small. 

I’ve spent a lot of time talking about identity, so what is my identity? I’ve tried to center it on as few values / axioms as possible, and I’m open to my identity changing over time, but this is my best attempt: Gratefulness.

There are a few corollaries here, which might illustrate my rationales and motivations. 
* Gratefulness to being alive, and a commitment to staying alive (and well), by working out, eating healthy, getting sleep, etc.
* Gratefulness for the people around me, and a commitment to learning and understanding them. Improving on finding and learning from uniquely inspiring traits that I believe everyone has, actively seeking out aspects of people that prove my impressions of them wrong. I believe in balancing extremes with regards to friendships, and I try to seek out people who care a lot about one thing, and surround myself with people like this in as many different areas as possible, to be able to have a deep appreciation of as many fields as possible.
* Gratefulness for kindness, and a commitment to loving people. Finding familiar strangers at school and lonely students on church benches to talk with and befriend, staying up creating surprise gifts. Building communities that encourage people to support each other and grow—Writing Club, Family Meetings, Math Club, Sunday School at Church, etc. 
* Gratefulness to the world for being really cool, and a commitment to learning as much as I can and actively using as many resources that I have access to. Both in terms of learning math deeply, but also gaining a broad appreciation for everything else the world has to offer—music, art, literature, programming, science. 
* Gratefulness to whoever (if there is a whoever) created the world, and a commitment to finding out if this creator exists, and if so, who they are. After all, you can’t be grateful if there’s no one to be grateful to. Actively researching and seeking out different religions, as well as approaching as many different religious worldviews with an open mind and a commitment to truth. 
* Gratefulness for change, and a commitment to improving the things I love. Changing the world—and the people in it—to become more kind and fulfilled, starting with myself. (I think this is my main motivation, and because of this I’m a bit of a pragmatist). Right now, I think education is the best way to achieve these ends, but I’m interested in hearing different ideas at SPARC :) 
* Gratefulness for having developed these ideals, even if I never fully attain them, and even if they’re not perfect. I think values are intrinsically beautiful, and I’m excited to continue improving on these ideals, and open to them changing over time.
